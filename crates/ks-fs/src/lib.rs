//! Kestrel file system layer: directory listing, drives, watching, git status, file operations
//! ([`ops`]: background jobs, conflicts, undo) and launching ([`launch`]: clipboard, open, editor, shell).
//!
//! Everything here is blocking or async work that runs off the UI thread; `ks-app`'s effect
//! runner calls it and reports results to the core as messages.
