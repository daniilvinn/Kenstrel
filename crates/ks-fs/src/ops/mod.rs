//! File-operation engine (PLAN section 7, phase P6).
//!
//! Self-contained: it does not depend on `ks-core`. The app wires it in by
//!
//! 1. creating one [`JobManager`] with an [`EventSink`] that turns each [`JobEvent`] into a `Msg`;
//! 2. building a [`JobSpec`] from the selection/yank register (`JobSpec::copy_into`,
//!    `move_into`, `rename`, `Trash`, `DeletePermanent`, `Create` via [`parse_create_input`],
//!    bulk rename via [`BulkRename`]) and calling [`JobManager::submit`] with the current
//!    generation id;
//! 3. answering [`JobEvent::ConflictPrompt`] with [`JobManager::resolve`];
//! 4. calling [`JobManager::cancel`] / [`JobManager::undo`].
//!
//! # Threading
//! Each job runs on its own `std::thread`; manager methods never block on IO and never touch
//! the caller's thread. Cancellation uses [`tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken`] internally
//! (checked between 4 MiB copy chunks and between directory entries). The engine logs through
//! `tracing` only.
//!
//! # Link policy
//! Symlinks and junctions are never followed while recursing (copy, scan, delete). Copy
//! recreates the link as a symlink; if that is not permitted the link is skipped and reported
//! as an [`ItemError`]. Move on the same volume renames the link itself. Delete removes the
//! link only.
//!
//! # Conflict policy
//! Directory onto directory merges silently and asks per file. See [`ConflictPolicy`],
//! [`ConflictChoice`] and [`Resolution`].
//!
//! # Long paths and Unicode
//! `std::fs` switches to `\\?\` paths for absolute paths over `MAX_PATH`; the engine absolutizes
//! every path on submit. Use [`paths::display`] (dunce) for showing paths.
